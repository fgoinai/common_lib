For method, the comment should follow the format below.
```
Arthor:     foo
Usage:      what?

(optional - start at next line after "Param:", one line one param)
(line break after param)
Return:     blablabla

```

For class, it is similar to method.
```
Arthor:     foo
Usage:      what?
Inheritance: (required, should be empty if no inheritance)
    Base: bar (Only ONE base class is allowed for a class, if not, edit your code)
    Trait: can_fly, can_bark (can have multiple here, which like interface in java)
(line break after Inheritance)
Param:
(optional - start at next line after "Param:", one line one param)
(line break after param)
Return:     blablabla
Remarks:    blablabla
